## Exercise - For-In Loops
 
 Create a for-in loop that loops through values 1 to 100, and prints each of the values.

//:  Create a for-in loop that loops through each of the characters in the `alphabet` string below, and prints each of the values alongside the index.
let alphabet = "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"

//:  Create a `[String: String]` dictionary, where the keys are names of states and the values are their capitals. Include at least three key/value pairs in your collection, then use a for-in loop to iterate over the pairs and print out the keys and values in a sentence.
let states: [String: String] = ["Hessen": "Wiesbaden", "Brandenburg": "Potsdam", "Bayern": "MÃ¼nchen"]
